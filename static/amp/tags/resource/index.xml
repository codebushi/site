      <description>Here are some of my favorite courses and videos for learning general Javascript and React.js. I recommend starting with a solid understanding of vanilla Javascript, learning some new ES6 features and techniques, and then finally moving onto React.js.
Note: Many of the courses mentioned are from Udemy.com and are frequently on sale. It seems like every 2 weeks or so, all Udemy courses are discounted to about $10 - $20, so I would recommend waiting a few days if you&amp;rsquo;re not seeing a sale of some sort.</description>

      <description>Quality photos and images can instantly make a website look better and feel more professional. Using random images from the internet can be a bad idea and lead to copyright issues. There are a bunch of great resources these days for free stock photography, all of which can be used with zero copyright restrictions. Here are some of my favorites:
